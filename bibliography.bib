	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

In a thermal spectrum, it would be possible to reach an acceptable concept only after in depth investigations taking into account the effect of the salt (negative feedback coefficient) and of the graphite (which makes the global feedback coefficient positive) separately. For very thermalized spectra, the global coefficients are negative thanks to the large neutron losses in the moderator but this leads also to a very poor breeding ratio. Epithermal or fast neutron spectra thus seem more favorable since they combine good feedback coefficients with satisfactory breeding ratio. However they lead to severe problems with the graphite’s ability to withstand the irradiation. As a result, the solution that removes the moderating block seems especially attractive."},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled MSRs, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The MSR is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, MSR concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early MSR work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) with enhanced proliferation resistance. MSRs have been selected as one of the Generation IV systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum MSRs, waste-burning MSRs, and MSRs fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle–based MSRs. This paper provides a historical background of MSR R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based MSRs by way of example.},

The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956, the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a circulating UF4-ThF4 fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy N pressure boundary. The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission’s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology and prospects for revived interest are summarized.},

	abstract = {In this work, the Monte Carlo burn-up code SERPENT-2 has been extended and employed to study the material isotopic evolution of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR).

This promising GEN-IV nuclear reactor concept features peculiar characteristics such as the on-line fuel reprocessing, which prevents the use of commonly available burn-up codes. Besides, the presence of circulating nuclear fuel and radioactive streams from the core to the reprocessing plant requires a precise knowledge of the fuel isotopic composition during the plant operation.

The developed extension of SERPENT-2 directly takes into account the effects of on-line fuel reprocessing on burn-up calculations and features a reactivity control algorithm. It is here assessed against a dedicated version of the deterministic ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (PSI-Switzerland) and adopted to analyze the MSFR fuel salt isotopic evolution.

Particular attention is devoted to study the effects of reprocessing time constants and efficiencies on the conversion ratio and the molar concentration of elements relevant for solubility issues (e.g., trivalent actinides and lanthanides). Quantities of interest for fuel handling and safety issues are investigated, including decay heat and activities of hazardous isotopes (neutron and high energy gamma emitters) in the core and in the reprocessing stream. The radiotoxicity generation is also analyzed for the MSFR nominal conditions.

The production of helium and the depletion in tungsten content due to nuclear reactions are calculated for the nickel-based alloy selected as reactor structural material of the MSFR. These preliminary evaluations can be helpful in studying the radiation damage of both the primary salt container and the axial reflectors.},

These applications pose new challenges for the tracking routines and result estimators, originally developed for a very specific task. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the basic collision estimator based cell flux tally in Serpent 2 is implemented, and how it is applied for calculating integral reaction rates. The methodology and its limitations are demonstrated by an example, in which the tally is applied for calculating collision rates in a problem with very low physical collision density. It is concluded that Serpent has a lot of potential to expand its scope of applications beyond reactor physics, but in order to be applied for such problems it is important that the code users understand the underlying methods and their limitations.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of nuclear reactors is a key technology in the quest for improvements in efficiency, safety, and reliability of both existing and future reactor designs. Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

The power production cost, including fuel-cycle and graphite replacement costs, with private utility financing, is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 mill/kWh less than that for present-day light-water reactors, largely due to the low fuel-cycle cost and high plant thermal efficiency.After engineering development of the fuel purification processes and large-scale components, a practical plant similar to the one described here appears to be feasible.},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the USA, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The USA focuses on the FHR, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The EU, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor.

	title = {The molten salt fast reactor as a fast spectrum candidate for thorium implementation},
	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

The graphite-moderated channel type MSR – one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts – was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics–thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

This study concentrates on the specific concept named Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Since this new nuclear technology is in development, safety is an essential point to be considered all along the research and development studies. After a short description of the MSFR systems, necessary to device accidental scenarios, this paper will focus on the decay heat evaluation of such a reactor. Among different contributions, the decay heat of fission products in the MSFR is evaluated to be low (3\% of nominal power), mainly due to the reprocessing during the reactor operation. As a result, the contribution of the actinides is significant (0.5\% of nominal power). However, the decay heat of the fission products is important, and among the different uncertainty sources, the fission yield uncertainties are pointed out. The unprotected loss of heat sink transients are studied in this paper. It appears that slow transients are favorable ( {\textgreater}1 min) to minimize the temperature increase of the fuel salt. This work will be the basis of further safety studies as well as an essential parameter for the design of the draining system.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor is one of the six concepts retained by the Generation IV forum in 2001. Based on the MSRE and MSBR concepts developed by ORNL in the 60s which involve a liquid fuel constituted of fluorine molten salt at a temperature close to 600°C, new developments with innovative approach and technology have been realized which contribute to strongly improve the concept. The thorium breeder potentiality is closely related to the use of a liquid fuel which is able to be periodically treated. A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products. According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the wastes radiotoxicity is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized. This paper describes an innovative reactor concept, the TMSR-NM (non-moderated thorium molten salt reactor), from the nuclear physic point of view and the different steps involving in the reprocessing scheme from the chemical point of view.},
